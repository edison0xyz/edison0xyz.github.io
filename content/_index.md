Hey, I am Edison Lim.

I am a programmer and entrepreneur based in Singapore.

I am the co-founder of [BasedApp](https://basedapp.io). *BasedApp* lets people spend crypto directly without having to off-ramp into a bank account, saving users lots of money in fees and headaches. I have spent the last three years working on crypto payments, first as a payment gateway and now as a card issuer. I've shared my learnings on [why crypto payments are hard to fix](https://x.com/edison0xyz/status/1811364931368833447).

Outside of main hustle, I have interests in:
* Exploring market structures and price discovery in crypto, which I sometimes develop (unprofitable) trading strategies;
* Tinkering with AI tools and models;
* Vibe-coding (latest obssession)

Before starting my own Company, I was:
* Engineering lead for zilliqa from 2018 to 2021, where i worked on systems engineering and did dev rel briefly to teach people to write smart contract code
* Tech lead for ![Alta Exchange](https://alta.exchange/), where I led a team to build OTC platform and custodian software to secure Capital Markets Services license from MAS.
* Built data pipelines for ML researchers at CMU under the leadership of Andrew Moore
  
I completed my M.Sc at Carnegie Mellon University where I specialised in distributed systems security. I am also an alumni at Singapore Management University.
