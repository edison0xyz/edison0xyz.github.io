hi, i am edison.

i am the co-founder of [basedapp](https://basedapp.io). basedapp lets people spend crypto directly without having to off-ramp into a bank account, saving users lots of money in fees and headaches. i have spent the last three years working on crypto payments, first as a payment gateway and now as a card issuer. this is my [plan](https://x.com/edison0xyz/status/1811364931368833447) to fix it.

before starting my companies, i did the following:
* engineering lead for zilliqa from 2018 to 2021, where i worked on systems engineering and did dev rel briefly to teach people to write smart contract code in an ocaml-like  programming language
* built custodian software from scratch, which helped a private equities exchange get their capital markets services (CMS) license from Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
* did data engineering pipelines for a year for ML researchers to do biomedical research (alright this is actually fun)

Other than engineering and building startups, i like to build (unprofitable) trading strategies. Sometimes you earn, sometimes you learn. I'm always learning.

I studied computing at Carnegie Mellon University - which also opened my eyes to the amazing world of crypto which I have not looked back on ever since.
